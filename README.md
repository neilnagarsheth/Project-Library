## Project Library ##

A program to manage and launch PC games from one program, regardless of whether it is on Steam/Battle.net/Origin etc.

If the game is tied to a DRM, that platform will launch before the game launches; however, this program will allow users
to keep track of all their PC games in one place.

This project was created in Viusal Studio 2013 version 12.0.3 Update 2, more details can be found on the wiki
